# Overview of Coins Project
 
We are an independent contractor for the U.S. Treasury Department. We have been tasked with implementing a Coin class in order to "test drive" new aspects of their coinage process. Sprint 1 started with us laying the ground work by implementing a Coin class that can create each different coin itself. Now, in sprint 2, we are seperating each individual coin from the Coin class and making them concrete implementations of the abstract Coin class, with new test files to go with each new class.
 
# Installation and Setup Guide
 
* First download the repository and if it is compressed extract the files into a folder.
* Open VSCode
* Open the folder in the window
* Open the Demo.java file
* Hit "run without debugging"
 
# Usage Instructions
 
* In order to run the Demo file uing the terminal, you must already have the terminal's path be the repository file. fter this you can run the command: java -cp src client.Demo
 
# Contribution Guidelines 
* Maxwell Brown - Started conversion of Coin class. Created Dime, Dollar, HalfDollar, Nickel, Penny, and Quarter classes.
* Gabriel Basham - Created CoinTest, PennyTest, NickelTest, DimeTest, QuarterTest, HalfDollarTest, DollarTest. Wrote readme file.
