# Coins Project Sprint 5 (Using Sprint 4 as a base)
## Version 0.1
* Gutted constructors so that the coins only have minimal data when constructed.
* Created manufacture method for the abstract coin class.
## Version 0.2
* Gutted constructors for concrete coin implementations.
* Created manufacture method for the concrete coin classes.
## Version 0.3
* Editted tests to work for new process of completing a coin object.
* The tests have not be changed much, because the object should still contain the same data in the end.
## Version 0.4
* Updated Observer class to manufacture coins instead of just constructing them.
* Added an ArrayList to make sure each coin is added to it and tracked instead of just created without any variable.
* Updated readme.md

# Overview of Coins Project
 
We are an independent contractor for the U.S. Treasury Department. We have been tasked with implementing a Coin class in order to "test drive" new aspects of their coinage process. We have had good progress with the Coins project, but coins are not constructed. In reality, coins are "manufactured." They go through a specific manufacturing process. We are tasked with simulating this manufacturing process. Sprint 4 had us adding observers, now in Sprint 5, we are making template methods for coin and a template method for each concrete implementations of coin along with updating the tests. Sprint 4's observers still work.
 
# Installation and Setup Guide and Usage Instructions
 
* First download the repository and if it is compressed extract the files into a folder.
* Open VSCode
* Open the folder in the window
* Open the Demo.java file
* Hit "run without debugging"
 
# Contribution Guidelines 
* Maxwell Brown - Added manufacture method to Coin class, helped edit constructors, edited tests and updated readme file.
* Gabriel Basham - Added manufacture to concrete implementations of the Coin class, helped edit constructors.
